## Getting Started with PSOC6 
2021-03-30 [#Blog](/index) | [#PSOC6](/posts/psoc6protoytpinggettingstarted)

In this post I'll let you know how to setup a development environment for [#PSOC6](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-6-microcontrollers-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4m0) from Infineon and execute the "Hello world" program.

### What is PSOC6? 
Before we start, let me quickly introduce you what PSOC6 is and what is used for.According to Infineon, the PSoC 6 family is built on an ultra-low-power architecture, and the MCUs feature low-power design techniques to extend battery life up to a full week for battery powered applications. The low power consumption makes the MCU interesting for gathering sensor data and many more applications. Normally in my projects I am using the Espressif MCUs. However, in the upcoming monthS, I'll build also some use cases with PSOC6 and compare the architectures. 
For more information about PSOC6, you can visit [this page](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-6-microcontrollers-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4m0).


### What hardware do you need?
* [PSOC 6 WiFi BT Protoyping Kit CY8CPROTO-062-4343W](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-wi-fi-bt-prototyping-kit-cy8cproto-062-4343w) for around 30 â‚¬. I bought this from RS components - [here](https://de.rs-online.com/web/p/entwicklungstools-microcontroller/1812206/)
* A notebook or PC to install the drivers and the Modus Toolbox for programming the MCUs

### Installation of Modus Toolbox
* open a browser and navigate to [www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CPROTO-062-4343W)
* download the Modus Toolbox software

### Connect the PSOC6 and start the "Hello World" programm
* Ensure that jumper J3 is at position 2-3 to select 3.3V

* Check the COM port in the Device Manager

![Check COM port](/assets/cy_connect02.jpg "Check COM port")

* Open a terminal programm, like e.g. Putty
* Connect to the COM port with baud rate of 115200

![Connect to board](/assets/cy_connect03.jpg "Connect to board")

* Press Switch 1
