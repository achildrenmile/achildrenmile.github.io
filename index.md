# Welcome to the blog

Hello there!
My name is Michael and I am an IT guy from Carinthia. I like to play around with technology and learn new things.
Idea behind this blog is to provide you articles about projects, ideas, etc. Inspired by [Bruno Hautzenberger's web site](https://hautzenberger.at/), who is using Hugo, the blog is static HTML using Jekyll provided and hosted by GitHub Pages. This makes blogging  
fun, because written and structured in here is using [#Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and so editing and updating is easy.
