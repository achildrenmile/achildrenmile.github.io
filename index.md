# Welcome to the blog

Hello there!
My name is Michael and I am an IT guy from Carinthia. I like to play around with technology and learn new things.
Idea behind this blog is to provide you articles about projects, ideas, etc. Inspired by [Bruno Hautzenberger's web site](https://hautzenberger.at/) (Thanks Bruno!), the blog is static HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) provided and hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This makes blogging fun, because using [#Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) makes editing and updating is easy.
